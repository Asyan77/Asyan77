# 🌈 Hello hello, I'm Ashley! ☀️
- 🔭 I'm currently working on my full stack clone of Flickr, called Burnr, to implement new features like Albums and Favorites. Additionally, I practice DS&A , solo and pairboarding, to keep my problem solving skills strong.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MERN stack, and looking forward to diving into some Python because I enjoy learning new technologies.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any new projects, reach out to me with your ideas! Or if you need help on your website shoot me an email :) 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help to gain a more solid understanding of the backend
- 💬 Ask me about any of my hobbies, like tennis, surfing, jiu jistu, meditation, burning man, yoga, or traveling!
- ⚡ Fun facts: I used to coach tennis and Jiu-Jitsu, as well as compete in Jiu Jitsu. I've visited 21 countires. As a side passion, I make and sell a specialty Taiwanese dish in San Francisco, Lu Ruo Fan.
